0,Great Culture and Company That Cares Not much politics and very few ego's. Everyone is willing to help which is refreshing. Not very tough recruiting A Player Talent as Aptiv is a place where most want to work. Need to focus on career growth and promoting within. Not much movement with internal candidates which turns into employees leaving.
1,"Shaping the Future of Mobility! Global Work Environment, Cutting Edge Technology Sector, Interesting Challenges None to mention at this time."
2,"Lots of potential- getting there A very fast paced environment - you definitely won't be bored and you learn lots in a short space of time A very global company- exciting to work with some many colleagues from all over the world, if a little daunting at first You can make decisions fast - less bureaucracy that other companies Really nice office facilities, young energetic team of people, good work colleagues. Training and coaching could be better- high expectations but needs more structure and stability to help people succeed"
3,"Black stain on the IDA - Kevin and Joe Show - no encore needed The marketing department is great at creating positive reviews on glassdoor. Disregard the obvious fake reviews, challenging work environment is short for toxic and unraveling as a recent million dollar survey announced. Can be hard to get your head around the global scale and complex divisional structures really means aptiv is full of fiefdom, to get anything done you need to follow a broken process using broken systems for no thought out reason for no recognition. Question anything - fired. have an opinion - fired. talk out of turn - fired. try something different - fired. The fear and toxic culture comes from CEO CFO dynamic duo all they way down - the need to impress wall street at all costs means nothing matters only numbers. Culture is a joke there is none. They are Trumpian rip off merchants overpaying themselves to fly all over the world telling people how important they are, Look out for them with their begging bowl in the coming months. Everything about this place is a con. Dont worry they will be shedding most of the irish workforce soon enough and move onto the next country willing to put up with the Kevin and Joe show."
4,"Bad culture, no HR alignment Fairly okay salary, key stakeholders good to work with HR is all over the place, no centralised HR, global comms are not aligned with local comms, miscommunication, favoritism, no annual bonus, poor incentives for HR team"
5,Good working place good package comparing to other companies IT chaos in terms of org and process
6,"Soulless company that grinds you into dust Beautiful offices, friendly work colleagues, free coffee and food, central location. This is the hardest company I've ever worked for - hard not because of the work, but because leadership make loyalty very difficult. I've spent my entire time here constantly wondering if the scheduled meeting with my manager is about me being fired. Honestly, I am only here until they fire me (which could be any day even though I excel in my reviews) or when I find a better job. Aptiv has either fired or lost all the hardworking, competent and talented staff they had in the last six months. Why? Because they are likely showing up their managers by being able to answer the questions and solve the problems they can't. And, of course costs, despite raising the GDP of a small nation in investment in the last quarter. To get a bit of perspective on the culture here: Aptiv's CEO told all staff on a company-wide call that work-life balance was a myth and you should structure your life around Aptiv. Morale is at an all time low. I wasn't experienced in the manufacturing sector prior to joining, and its a cut-throat sector. Aptiv is a manufacturing company trying to pivot into a tech company, but all senior leadership are from the manufacturing sector. American manufacturing management mythologies, everything is about cutting cents, so that the leadership can bolster their stock options."
7,"Great Company with Progressive Technology Rare opportunity in Ireland to work in the automotive manufacturing industry. Genuine career opportunities. The company truly embraces diversity. Strong CEO and sense of being in the right place at the right time. Salary, pension and health benefits above average but bonus is only average. Good social scene, great offices and location, free breakfast, friendly co-workers and some memorable nights out. Top-heavy management structure. Unfortunately there are too many middle management layers who only have administration/delegation capability rather than hands-on capability and direct experience."
8,"""Best place I've ever worked"" Great place to build new skills. Work with smartest people in the industry. Lots of benefits and competitive pay. Work life balance. Slow hierarchical progression."
9,"Horrific still having nightmares My exit interview as i could see light at the end of the tunnel 😀 Micro management, really bad culture as in NO culture. Really showing true colours during Covid forcing people to take holidays and unpaid leave and laying people off redundancies HR totally useless"
10,"Great Great place to work, lots of very talented people working in a complex global environment. Lots of learning opportunities Can be hard to get your head around the global scale and complex divisional structures."
11,"Terrible Culture Interesting technological challenges Diverse infrastructure and requirements, manufacturing, engineering Terrible challenge Poor management NO leadership Highly political environment Company is doing terribly, many job losses"
12,Employer review Good to start with new levels HR policies need extensive revision.
13,"If Carlsberg did bad places to work, they probably wouldn't be as bad as here Very little really, many were sold a vision that never actually had c-level commitment behind it. Then people were told that this was never what was said in the first place. There is no forward-thinking going on (at least within the Dublin office). If anyone tries to do something new massive resistance is put in their way and in some cases they are just 'removed' to stop their efforts. They got a large number of very talented people to leave good jobs based on both a large salary jump and a promise of interesting and challenging work, for many the sweet taste of the increased paycheck has well soured since very little of the work they were hired to do ever got a budget or support to proceed. So Pros: You might get a salary bump, but you'll regret it nearly instantly. The location is very good. The building is great if you want to 'look' like you work in a modern company. Where to start. Basics: No parking, no stock for normal employees, exceptionally poor leadership, nearly everything is out-sourced. For Dublin in particular, pretending to be Corporate HQ is a joke, as a site it is so removed from the actual activities of the wider company it may as well be a call center. No culture, in fact, the employees recently got the blame for a bad culture score, the remedy? Hold an all-hands where we were told ""Go make a better culture"", this must be the only improvement program they haven't out-sourced, which goes to show how much they care about that. Relocated numerous staff members from various countries only to now make a sizable number of them redundant, very classy move. Hire numerous talented IT professionals than not support them either by connecting them with the wider company or budgeting for the work they were hired to do. Sack people who rocked the apple cart and actually started to make a difference across many functions IT, SCM and Finance."
14,"Stay clear of this company Some good people, all struggling to survive such a toxic environment Toxic culture primarily due to leadership team. Employees are not valued. No recognition, appreciation or support. All are disposable widgets to be used and then discarded."
15,"Going about as well as Brexit really, isnt't it? shiny new office (fancy fingerprint sign-in doesnt always work) , handy to DART. that's about it really.... let's face it, it's going about as well as Brexit. Weak , inexperienced US managment on their first international assignment are out of their depth and struggling. Supply chain , finance and tax are complete losses- just stay clear of them ......."
16,"Cutting edge on Automotive Technology, Better Than Average Benefits and Pay The environment is changing to become more a of software development company and focus on next generation automotive solutions for the brain and nervous system of the automobile. Great people to work with. Very demanding management teams to get more done in an environment with constant change, turnover, and knowledge gaps."
17,"Rebranded as a tech company but really a Dinosaur. Stay away. Good salaries, Nice office location in Grand Canal Dock Too much red tape, Slow decision making, Very Hierarchical. Weak senior staff"
18,APTIV Ireland Great Culture Generous Package Good Working Environment Lots of OpportunitiesAPTIV Pace can be hectic at times Priorities can shift quickly with little warning
19,"good so far Interesting growing company lots of opportunities very complex ,jobs very specialised"
20,"not for everyone Remuneration for some levels, could get a decent manager. Interesting work and loads of responsibility. Remuneration often not worth it, no matter how much. Finance and tax function is mad. Senior management can be counter productive and drive away people or minimises motivation. Unrealistic expectations and approach from certain leaders creates uncomfortable workplace."
21,"Finance Good Salary, Nice Offices, Work Interesting, and varied, opportunities to travel depending on area of business you are in, some of the people are inclusive HR unsophisticated not strategic, staff are a number treated badly, staff under huge pressure to deliver to unrealistic deadlines, Dublin corp office hiring and firing within 11 month probation period pulling people out of secure jobs then dumping them callously, no management structures in place, a lot of shouting, staff distressed within months of being there, American managers think they are in US not Ireland using US practices a lawsuit waiting to happen"
22,"Mistake Looks decent externally, pretend to be part of the future. Not a technology company. Sterile office environment. Unreasonable expectations. Rough, micro-managing senior leadership, especially within Finance. Monolithic culture that does not seem to embrace differences. People are angry and disengaged. Lots of screamers. Work for the sake of work, which creates constant swirl."
23,FLDP Great exposure to different roles in the global corporation. Be able to move every year arround the world.
24,Stay Clear Very little...some nice people but thats about it No work life balance...managers rule by fear....unreasonable expectations
25,"A rolling start..... Exciting product offering, very direct, positive, open culture, right to CX level. Excellent support from HR and management teams. Huge potential for growth as a company and personally. None! There are always issues with companies going through significant change, but at Aptiv, they’re very good at getting out in front of them and communicating clearly, there really are no issues that aren’t acknowledged and being addressed at pace."
26,Good Company to work for. Wonderful atmosphere and flexible work life balance. Flexible work life balance Very good relocation package. Good Exposure . Senior Leadership is always available for any inputs/feedback. Perks Benefits Good Compensation Challenging roles but based upon individual interest Diverse Culture No share purchase plan Dependency on suppliers
27,"Coolest job ever! Cool cars when they worked. The invaluable lessons learned from the disgusting emotional games that were honestly well played. The blatant, wide spread drug use was fun! If your goal is to see the worst humans have to offer in the workplace this is the spot for you! Moving up was relatively easy for the chosen few, a bathroom bump and hump is all it took. If you did find yourself in a sticky situation that would make the company/tech look bad, no worries because they will cover it all up and still keep you working until you’re no longer needed. Upper management, middle management, all management especially the HR department. The complete disregard for the humanity of operators. The social/political tactics used by far are some of the most vile and amazingly well executed I’m a bit jealous. They are predatory sociopaths and very adept at exploiting personal issues and working as a well oiled pack to systematically break you down so you quit or stop caring entirely so they fire you. Every day was a slow drip of your existence being squeezed out of you drop by drop, all while your tormentors smiled and said good job everyone while simultaneously picking the next groups of stragglers to make an example of. But if you were one of the actual good ones taking true pride in what you did and exceeded the standards, oh they took delight in making sure they broke you down proper and with devastating precision."
28,"Get it together not many i can attest to, maybe the people ? Everything - This place does not have an idea what Agile really means, it implements everything on a separate agenda aka there is no coordination at the TROY location let alone the global platoform which is a mess of its own. They cut way too many employees masked as covid issues. This place will work you to the bone and ask for more as you bleed out. Those that are there are stuck there due to visas which i think they did on purpose for cheaper labor as well as employee retention. I have never walked through an office where people are so sad that they are stuck with thier current situation. Upper management keeps saying they are going to make it better - and then has a re-org. within the last 3 years there have been at least 3 re-orgs. if that doesnt sell you RED FLAG i dont know what will. stay away from TROY location."
29,"Toxic Work Environment The pay was great for the midwest, but that's likely the only way they can get people to join I've never worked in a more toxic environment in my career. People are throw under the bus regularly for things that were the fault of management. Job security is abysmal - I've never seen so many people let go from an organization, and no, this was pre-Covid, so it can't be blamed on that contraction. At the same time, the amount of corporate waste and wheel spinning was mind boggling. It doesn't seem like there's a clear strategy at the top - projects are started, killed, restarted, killed again. Honestly, I don't know how this company stays in business - oh yeah, I do! If you're a Tier 1 auto supplier your OEM customers can't afford to let you go out of business. GM was right to spin out this anchor before it dragged them to the bottom with it."
30,Good Employer! You can learn a lot! Global international project Friendly & helpful coworkers Good benefits package (even employee pension plan which is rare in the local market) Frequent overtime work Sometimes lack of understanding of local needs by global management

37,Great for work life balance Best for work life balance Didnot find anything till now

48,Best place to work and learn 1. Encouragement to focus on personal goals along with org goals 2. Voice is always heard 3.

The things we've been able to accomplish across the globe with multi-national teams have been truly remarkable. The culture at APTIV is more of a shapeless forming blob. As Delphi, APTIV had a distinct culture of ""Excellence"" stemming back to the Packard days, and a proud history there as well. Companies such as Control-Tec and Unwired also had their own distinct cultures that were more like google and made your team feel more akin to family. Plenty of work got done above and beyond due to this. Now those have been stripped away into the APTIV Culture, and it is palpable in comparison to those hay-days."

168,"The gap between employer branding and reality Colleagues, salary, flextime, proximity to the university campus, parking lot situation, interesting technological challenges. Human resources needs to cope with the projects won is usually estimated intentionally optimistically. Why do I belive its intentionally? Because it happens all the time and there is no example I am aware of where estimates reflect even close to 60% of what is actually needed. Often, good experts are promoted to engineering group managers (EGMs), although they are the wrong choice when it comes to team development and team empowerment. If a supervisor has good hard skills but still has room for improvement in terms of managing people, he or she should be encouraged to consult HR at an early stage if any conflicts in the team cannot be resolved. The inclusion of HR for problems in the team should not be interpreted as a weakness, flaw or a negative entry in a fictitious file about the team leader, but rather as a virtue and scknowledged by HR as athe right thing to do.. This is very important for a successful and large company like Aptiv, as the organizational structures change regurarly, even if this is not surprising considering the strong position in the market. In general, Aptiv is very successful and there is a lot of projects, which also has very positive side effects that the future is bright in terms of employees having lots of projects and work to be done. However, due to the high workload with hard deadlines, there is far too little time for the EGMs to manage their teams, to identify problems in the team at an early stage and to tackle those. As a result, there are often employees in the same team where some are overloaded and others are bored."
169,work life Best place to start carrier Difficult to manage time between personal and professional life due to hectic work
170,Company Great company and technology to work with Nothing much in particular I have
171,"Working For Free Outstanding Technology and product portfolio. Really ahead of competition in quality and offer to the mobility HEV market. Money at all costs. This is a company, executives and management are willing to do whatever it takes to their people to get profit. There is a Disgusting disguise of a Think like Owner to make you feel guilty for not working 20h non stop. And please feel bad for not replying that email 9pm on Saturday. They make you feel you will be fired at any moment if you don’t accept this. Half the team is on Furlough and they don’t bother in calling you and having you work. Working for free is committed for them. It is just sad such a great company treats their people like trash. And as I see the more you advance in this company the more you are treated like garbage. No value for capabilities. No space for mistakes and there is always someone to be blamed and of course fired. Hire and fire."
172,"A good first job Friendly working environment, fairly loose deadlines, good relatonship with managers, nice office location Similar projects, repetetive workload, relatively outdated computers"
173,"Fair Not bad but less vacations than a OEM. Narrow minded, lower salaries than OEMs."
174,"unclear strategy good salary, flexible home working very top down and highly centralised decision making"
175,Good place People are nice and smilong Hard to implement improvements there
176,Great place for fresher in automobile industry Flexible working hours for graduate students Get ready for a lot of presentations
177,"Excellent Experience Good people, wide product portfolio narrow focus scope. Too much reply on a few big customers."
178,Great company with bad leadership great projects and great people to work with bad leadership and lack of vision
179,"dont go there nice shiny office, that's it phew where to start? forced redundancies within a year of starting, reduced pensions, incompetent senior managers"
180,Great place to work at. 1. Aptiv is a good company to work at with good balance of work and personal life 2. I like the fact that its stress free and encourages to learn while working 3. Made some good friends over time Growth on the leadership level is slow
181,"APTIV IGS Easy hire to the company No management support at IGS`s UA. Werry bad work process organization for employers. 0 support from managment side in Projects running. 0 motivation and no salary increasing. Huge financial problems during New Projects Launching is laying on the Engineering, and after start up no any encouragement. Working more than 2 years on Dummy Company which was hired to save costs - not even APTIV. Loaded by Responcibilities like for 5 people but sallary like 0.5. during COVID-19 company forced to leave at own expense - and you must go - because afraid to lose Job during COVID-19."
182,"Old-fashioned Slaughterhouse Interesting products in the IVI, ADAS, Security area with leading edge technology (at least some) Equipment and IT support is ridiculous. No career opportunities or guide from direct manager or management side (most of them, not all)."
183,"Start you career but don't get stuck, it's not like that everywhere Currently going through Lean transformation Poor recruitment effort resulting in a unbalanced work load. Whoever has better knowledge and skills is overloaded with work. Excel driven Company trying to deal with large datasets. Unqualified management trying to control frequently using manipulation."
184,"Would Not Recommend No pros about this company Toxic work environment, silo'd, yelling and screaming at people."
185,"Just ok very innovative , interesting projects poor work / life balance"
186,Excellent Working Environment Flexible Schedule and great leadership. None at the moment that is relevant mentioning.

191,Away from this place Don't even try to think of this place Everything cons. Away from this place
192,Good learning experience Good place to learn Works on advanced technology in active safety Good benefits and pay Long hours / poor work life balance
193,"Vehicle systems engineer Good company to work and explore Next gen technology No comments, only thing is no work load balance"
194,"Great people, questionable leadership This review is subjected to the Allen Park office ONLY. Aptiv acquired Control-Tec, who was great and where most of the pros stem from. Note that other offices have completely different cultures/benefits. - Great people to work with, culture is about making sure everyone is on the same page and just wants to build something great. Teamwork is a non-issue. PMs and devs are your partners through and through. - Cross-functional folks and users are amazing and kind people. Very passionate about their work and willing to help you as much as they can, whether it's teaching, including, and giving constructive feedback. - WLB is great, though once in a while a push is needed to deliver, and with take-as-you-need/unlimited vacation, you can't get better than that (Allen Park office only). - Culture events like board/video game nights, whiskey/beer guilds, bbq days, and food truck summers were plentiful at the Allen Park office. - Management are often at a disconnect with upper management/leadership strategies, which gets worse at IC level. After Aptiv acquisition, product teams including SME experts were unsure/unconfident about the product they were asked to build. Validation and justifying product decisions/directions was a constant sore point between product and upper management. - Be prepared to be the only UX resource across multiple products/PM's. Once the ratio was 1 UX : 7 PMs : 30+ developers. Be prepared to brutally prioritize and deliver what you can. You are also a PM, but the pay won't reflect this. - During COVID-19, Allen Park Aptiv quietly laid people off after leadership made assurances of that not being the case. 2 months later, and right after 6 weeks of furloughs, layoffs ensued. Roles including mine and high-performing software engineers were affected."
195,"Project leader for Daimler Dynamic, good team, interesting project A lot of overtime works."
196,"Okay No work pressure. Sit back and relax like government office. Worst Management, micro management of employees. No diversity."
197,good money but terrible culture pay plus benefits - big cars the culture does not respect the basic values
198,"Great place to work *Company with great vision *Great learning & Challenging work *Supportive manager & Team *Better work life balance * Decent pay acc to current market rate * Facility should be improved - canteen, parking, Wellness room etc."
199,"Great for a start Great atmosphere, modern hardware, ability to extend your knowledge, remote work during the pandemic Low pay for students, often repetitive tasks"
200,Best Company to be This company provide the best remuneration. Not really good is limited parking area.
201,Great place great pay friendly work environment confusing work environment management seems lost
202,"A radar company failing to be a tech company Flexible work hours, little expectations Management doesn't know how to make or sell software"
203,"Executive Company Portfolio , the people working in mid level jobs keeping it going daily! The quality of products Top Managment , & Culture, lack of true diversity and treatment of people that work there, work life balance, focus on cost vs growth, top management is a boy’s club, believes US workers are too expensive and older workers need to go; does not value loyalty"
204,Good company Many opportunities to be successful at Aptiv if you’re hardworking and like to be involved with continuous improvement. Total rewards package is very good. Very siloed company with much duplication. Value “OneTeam” is aspirational versus reality.
205,Very good working condition Good working condition in plant System not use many time in plant
206,Overall good. opportunity to work with interesting automotive projects. As usual in corp. Sometimes much work due to cumulative tasks.

216,Review headline Challenging work & very nice colleagues Slow management decisions Bad canteen and food
217,Lost Focus on Manufacturing Global Company with an innovative working team Sr. Management has lost focus on manufacturing and it could have a negative impact in the long term
218,"work It was my first job out of college, and I liked most of the people I worked with. I got to work on some interesting stuff. There was a big age gap when I got hired, as most of the engineers had been there pre ~2008 crash. There was a period there where the company took on a more projects that its personnel count could support, so there was a good chunk of salaried overtime."
219,Good company Work environment is good and this is excellent opportunity to learn about future mobility. It is hard to balance between work and life.
220,"A company under transformation If you like challenges, and change Aptiv is the place for you, the company right now is evolving from being a pure manufacturing company to become an Industrial Tech one, developing technology that can make vehicles safer and more connected. Aptiv genuinely cares for people There is constant change in the company as part of the transformation."
221,"Poor company culture, poor management, constant organisational changes Relaxed work environment. Interesting technologies to work on. Friendly people. Quite a lot of hypocrisy and discrimination when it comes to salary and roles (but also getting a job). This is specific to HR, but not only. Very difficult to get a job offer without an internal referral. Micromanagement at all levels. Slow decision making process, decisions often overturned."
222,"Good Company, Good Learning Opportunity 1. Work culture is quite open and almost like a startup 2. Great learning opportunity if you are willing to learn 3. Freedom to develop new things and experiment Salaries should be higher. Need to standardize certain work protocols"
223,Good company very friendly co-workers and challenging task to keep you motivated none from my experience working at Aptiv
224,"Good opportunities to learn Self learning, and opportunity to move within the company Salaries are not competitive in comparison."
225,"Best Company in automotive, offers good package to employees Nice place for work, supportive staff. Nothing to mention here right now"
226,"environment is all about politics good place for people just want to get paid, doesn't matter if you can do the work or not as long as you got hired here the direction of how to do self-driving car is wrong here, already falls behind the industry, but the marketing is really good at bluffing, and makes its stock price looks pretty good. But this is not good for your career path, and you will find your skills are mostly out of date in the related industry."
227,Work Life Balance good Work Life Balance and for career growth nothing to be updated now
228,"Good learning experience Good learning experience, got opportunity to explore different areas Nothing that has till date"
229,Good Company for Freshers with attractive incentives 1) Attractive Incentives 2) Good Heath Benefit Insurance 3) Good 401K Match 4) Friendly Work Culture 1) Frequent Management Changes 2) Unstable Hierarchy stack 3) Unpredictable Management decisions 4) Middle Layer Management Issues
230,"ok good working environment, food, poeple management, salary, projection, life-work, shifts"
231,"Good company to work at Lots of benefits (medical,dental,etc) Access to many new technologies. Management could be a bit toxic sometimes."
232,Experience ok transport was provided by company no growth opportunity in the company location
233,Nice Nice industry and working on popular area Nothing special to complain about

245,Program Manager Good strategic direction of the company Lot of internal changes in the company
246,Great company Very chill and laid back work environment. The salary was a bit lower than expected.
247,"Active Safety / User Experience Leading tech in growing areas of the automotive industry with lots of potential. Lots of talented people and opportunity to work with people from around the globe with varying ideas & perspectives. Management silos created road blocks and duplicate efforts that didn't align with other group efforts & management not being transparent with employees about future business path. They don't value experienced people as they should but rather employ lower cost entry level people. I predict closing the North American Infotainment & Driver Interface business will be a mistake in the long run, when historically it was always profitable for the company. But Autonomous & related Software/Services are now their only focus."
248,"Algorithm Developer Great manager, work life balance frequent management changes, poor tech lead"
249,Program Manager Great people to work with Long hours / hard to balance work and life
250,Good and stable company. The employee work-life balance is important. As most of the companies great part of your development depends on your manager.
251,"Mobility, Autonomous Vehicles, Driver Monitoring Systems 1. Technically ahead of the curve 2. Engineer friendly work culture to die for! 3. Individuals can work thru the org to develop or grow themselves, there is place for all 4.Open culture respects diversity 5.Open leadership communication, Flexible 1. Branding attention required in India"
252,Work-life balance and salary package are the problems Good technology and learning opportunities Work life balance Salary increments are poor No fun activities
253,Very supportive employer A lot of projects and easy team change Nothing much to describe. Would be better if there was more work from home option
254,"Decline in manufacturing world at Aptiv It is hard to come up with any.... Corporate leaders keep squeezing the budget and will not hire people in our manufacturing plant. We are losing people and management will not replace them. We used to have three electrical controls engineers and are now down to one. If he is off and we have problems, who do we call? Same is true for the process engineers working on the manufacturing floor. Management does not want to replace the guys that left and expect the other process engineers to deal with it. Not sure how one guy can do the work of two people."
255,"Terrible Place to Work Competitive salary, great teammates, international environment Low transportation allowance, poor organization at all levels, frequent changes of plans"
256,"Decent place fun exciting palce to work some people arent great, some managers"
257,"decent place always busy, latest technology, nice work environment bottom line means the most"

259,"Worst company in the world Nothing for me to add Lack of organization, massive owertime,"
260,Great place for work Amazing projects for future cars Too many roles and not clear responsibilities in the project organization. Project scaling not optimal.
261,"Highly engaged and transparent leadership Clear vision and encourages employees to think like owners Convenience of IT, difficult to turn off"
262,"Product: Bussed Electrical Centers Great place for learning, good benefits, excellent facilities Not big opportunities to grow internally"
263,Worth Exploring Strong vision and focus on employee safety Lacking communication about role expectations
264,Worth Exploring Strong vision and focus on employee safety Lacking communication about role expectations
265,"Work Life Balance Good place for Learning, good knowledge growth , good labs no good facilities , like cafeteria , and campus"
266,"Amazing project Great people, great env, open minded Long hours, sometimes stressful, working hard"
267,Aptiv Morocco not recommended Good professional first learning experience. Toxic envirement no encouragement stressful envirement low evolution opportunities weak HR management Basic salery and no extra ever
268,Just okay for learning 1. Learning curve 2. Flexible working hours 3. Good colleagues 1. Pathetic infrastructure 2. Canteen is a disaster; food sucks to the core. 3. No bonus 4. Onboarding and exit process is more challenging than the projects executed. HR department is as though non existent in the organization. Too much paperwork.
269,Legacy company No any issue in aptiv Good carrier growth for long buisness
270,Good experience Good experience for entry level position Leadership doesn’t listen to employees only their cliques
271,International work environmet Very international environment in its facilities No bonus provided to its emplyees
272,Material planner No proper lunch and its common No personal and work life balance
273,"Good company to work Good learning, flexible working hours, freedom for doing right things Lack of vision locally in TCI"
274,"Kai works with Engineers at different location. Workplace harmony, in that co-worker does their level best to help one another Server for project management occasionally shuts down"
275,"Toxic work environment Salary is competitive Good technology Benefits are good Industry on a positive trend Highly toxic work environment. Workplace bullying tolerated. Starts from the CFO and rolls down. HR doesn’t care. They are scared to do what is right. Everyone bad mouths other groups and other employees as a habit. Profanity, aggressive behavior, and backstabbing culture are the norm."
276,"Nice Place to Work - May be poorly managed Nice atmosphere, generous salaries, nice facilities and benefits Money problems, layoffs, moving jobs to Mexico"
277,Work here at your own risk Nothing much except for the fact that there are some good projects but one has to be lucky to work on those projects. And yes expect a good learning curve because most of these projects are not very well structured and are rather mis-managed. Bad work life balance for engineers. Lateral hires are over-promised and it leads to a lot of issues. Mid-level managers (Lateral hires in particular) are considered very much redundant and their job security is under lot of risk. Financially company is not doing very well. Immature management. Aptiv India is globally not very well recognized within Aptiv.
278,"Do your research, mobility vs manufacturing. Great sales pitch, and relocation. Lies, confusion and tons of miserable people locked in their relocation. No integrity, loyalty or supporting environment. Toxic culture."
279,"Great learning opportunity. During my time there, the company transitioned to Dublin, Ireland Minimal management direction and no career path"
280,"Exciting place to work! Great people, greaqt vision, exciting technology Never enough time to get everything done"
281,Great Friendly environment and nice place to work I personally did not found any Cons

287,Overall Nice Place to Work At Great Teams. Great working environment. Cafeteria food sucks. Too less company holidays
288,Best place to work in Automotive domain Pay is Good Work life balance Sufficient leaves Medical insurence No much onsite opportunity Sometimes projects are less Less R&D project for India sites Less projects from indian OEMs
289,CONSTANT RESTRUCTURING COMPANY A big company with great culture A lot of restructuring of the company therefore constant threat of layoffs
290,Great company with some downfalls Great pay. Schedule for a VO is 4 - 10 hour shifts during the week. Benefits package is on the lower end for a 'start-up' with a lot of money. Not much job growth or movement once you're in your hired role
291,"Interessante Aufgaben, schlechtes Management Interesting tasks and field. Bad management, decisions are very sudden and not properly thought through. The company is just trying to take as much projects as they can while not having the capacity or competency to execute them, ending up in bad work-life balance for employees and chaotic operation."
292,"Start Up Company, Growing Pains, Diversity, High Tech, Multi City/ Country One of Companies with Top Paying driving position in Vegas. Provides snacks and drinks. Lunch once a week. Employee Center with big screen tv with game consoles, Ping Pong and Foosball tables Monthly news updates. Management is always open to new ideas. Bad Attitudes from some Vehicle Operators. Vehicle Operators that were let go have bad reviews due to their misguided opinions on how to run a company."
293,"Good company to start with Work life balance, Good exposure, management is good Salary is not so good"
294,"autonomous driving Good working enviroment, good project at company. architecture disorder, change a lot which wasting time"
295,Great Place to work High tech. Collaborative environment. Great benefits. No cons to bring up at this point.
296,"GOOD PLACE Good Working Environment Decent Pay Less Pressure Job Security, No Future Plans for the Design Engineer, Nothing to study new"
297,Very comfortable work environment Great work environment. Top of the line equipment. Keeps employees in the loop of what's going on with the company. Great pay Kind of lacking on follow through from upper management sometimes.
298,Good challenging work Good work and work culture Dynamic and agile I don't think there is any
299,"Miserable Place to Work Competitive Pay and benefits. That's it. Poor management, high stress, excessive hours."
300,Technical Lead Very nice company to work Salary little less as compared to market.
301,Review Good work profiles and career growth Not sure as of now
302,Pretty Good School comes first and they know that to be true Communication is slow with other branches and you are often sitting on your hands doing nothing (also kind of a pro though)
303,Good company to work for Good product company to work on new technology. Working both in infotainment and ADAS domains. No variable pay Good work life balance at Aptiv. Facilities needs to be improved
304,"Great environment and people Competitive pay, great people, the benefits are really good, and many opportunities to move into areas of interest. Holidays could be better and slow on boarding into the job."
305,"Great benefits. Good co-workers Great 401k Match and HSA contributions from Aptiv. Aptiv sponsored Education Assistance. Affordable insurance plans. Good employee discount portfolio Subsidized food at the cafeteria. Some of the brightest minds in the industry are currently working here. Great future outlook and opportunity to create products that will help people in real world. Insurance plan is high deductible HSA. While Aptiv contributes to the HSA account, the out of pocket maximum is quite high. No flat co-pays at ERs and Urgent Cares. As a relatively new company with people from all backgrounds, the processes have something to be desired."
306,Indirect Procurement Fast learning and vast opportunities for career advancement Continues high management strategy readjustments
307,"TERRIBLE LEADERSHIP Very nice people to work with Leadership is terrible. They discuss employees with other employees, attack you when they don't understand and always play the blame game. Some of the management screams and yells at their employees to the point that their employees are in tears. This is The atmosphere in the company is so difficult and people always feel like they are walking on eggs around leadership in HR not knowing what to expect from one day to another. I worked for the company for a very long time and loyalty doesn't mean a thing to them."
308,Good Environment Good Salary and work culture Nothing like cons in aptiv
309,"Dysfunctional at its Best Other than a decent compensation , not much pros here. Highly Political . No Value for good work.. No Over Time.. No more a North American Company , every project is heavily outsourced/offshore based , Management has no vision or clarity , Lack of Transparency and interest towards employees."
310,"Evil There are none. This company is evil. HR and Legal middle-management are stupid, arrogant and cruel. Avoid working in these areas. Also beware of working for a company with HR staff who are so mean-spirited."
311,Very interesting company to work for Freedom and research nature Creates cool autonomous vehicles The office is located outside of CBD
312,"Senior software engineer Great work ethics and good environment Low pay, non flexible if you'd want to explore more in different teams"
313,"Innovating and growing company in the automotive space Great overall benefits and good culture. Good worklife balance. Company is well-positioned to take advantage of the trends in Safety, Green and Mobility Healthcare benefits are not as great."
314,Great Place to Work! Solve exciting and tough engineering problems. The innovation is very rapid and everyone is passionate about their work. Typical pains of companies experiencing fast growth.
315,"Beginner level mistakes are still frequent Salaries are high because they have a hard time attracting good talent. Management at Pittsburgh office is mostly incompetent. Some leaders are clueless to the role they serve, being too smart to ever consider they don't know what they are doing. They are making beginner level mistakes with regards to how to manage people and not putting competent people in important roles. They manage to miss deadline after deadline because they realize they have built so much framework on an inadequate foundation, which makes everything new hard. Constant fighting with corporate office in Boston creates more chaos and a lack of leadership or direction. There are smart people at Aptiv, however - the really smart people leave quickly."
316,Great Management Good Management system and good pay Less employee benefits and Team spirit is low
317,"Overall Good Overall Work Culture is Fine. Salary is Fair. Flexible Timings. Work from Home Options (based on roles & responsibility). Freedom to express when it comes to work. Domination on Employees is less. Work Results were always appreciated & acknowledged through certifications & rewards. Hardwork is always recognized. In certain ways, People caring they execute. Work life balance possible, if expectations are kept always less. Workload depends on the project one works. Cafeteria Facilities are worse. Career growth inside the Organization is heavily limited. Designation will not be given even for well experienced. Expectations are always high. Less Engineering Resources. Abroad Opportunities are less, if one looks for it. Besides, taking up Aboard Trips from start till bill settlement is hectic."
318,Short Term Review There is a pretty flexible work schedule with a quick assignment of responsibilities. Benefits aren't as competitive as I hoped while on-boarding process isn't very clear and concise.
319,Good company and environment Good Pay Nice Colleagues Good work Immense opportunities Worst canteen. Bachelors struggle for food. No fun at work
320,"Easy work, pay is alright. Almost not worth the internal nonsense if you know your value and won’t compromise that. Snacks, gym, company phone. 1 free meal a week and the benefits are ok. And the job itself is cool and cutting edge. Most of the people are cool and will get down after work. Benefits are expensive and require somewhat significant additional costs ( hope you don’t actually need healthcare) the management is more talk than action and tell you to do one thing and they do another (usually something they told you not to do) Communication is poor at times, seems like they don’t pass on the important stuff to one another. HR is a nightmare and deliberately targets workers with what seems like impunity and personal motivations. The free meal every week is at times questionable (undercooked chicken and stuff like that) the lunch break is a bit short. Drivers voice concerns and they don’t seem to hold a lot of value, even with things concerning safety or similar issues. Overall the environment is a “do as I say, not as I do” mentality, and if you don’t like it leave. You have a personal life? That’s fine as long as it doesn’t interfere with your job of being a taxi driver. Favoritism is alive and well, but don’t say anything about it. They know and don’t seem to care. The people who take it serious and want to do the best they can and are genuine don’t matter. Fake it until you make it is the name of the game. Oh and want to make one of those confidential complaints or report an issue? Better do it from somewhere else because the so called line and website to do so is not even accessible from your work phone or office WiFi, and the number provided is apparently disconnected and unreachable! If you are looking to waste your time but collect a check this is for you! Show up, shut up, and do the minimum is the name of the game. And their so called transparency is just that, so called. They tell you what you want to hear and you’re supposed to like it."
321,"good people, poor values Good teams, dedicated people, truly international company Aptiv do not care about its own people, became US centric since few years"
322,Financial Jenga pulling out as many things as possible before it falls In a lean organization you get exposure to many things above your pay grade It is distracting when you are concerned that another round of restructuring will catch you in their net.
323,Electrical engineer It is nice people around you. Family kind of atmosphere. Here and there there are some fun projects to work on Bad upper management. Yearly reviews can be painfull. Pretty slow career progression. Not a good work life balance package. You have to buy extra vacation time
324,Average Enough time to learn new things for freshers. It is very difficult to adapt working culture
325,"IT Supply chain manager Analyst Big company, good culture, values, good atmosphere is temporary collaborating on a temporary project"
326,Great Place to Work Great perks & benefits Great people Not close to city center
327,Great Place to work Great company with innovation and willing to support their personnel on preparation. Work environment needs to be improved.
328,Great Place to work Great company with innovation and willing to support their personnel on preparation. Work environment needs to be improved.
329,"Great place to develop personally and professionally Familiar atmosphere, no visible hierarchy in the office, collaborative people and good energy. Very good organizational approach from management. Continuous training on board and possibility to grow and develop. Honestly I don't see any."

332,good very good with good work life balace everything is going good nothing cons to say
333,"Low stress work environment with beyond poor management Low stress, great work schedule, pay is more than sufficient, most employees are friendly and approachable Beyond poor management, any good suggestions fall on deaf ears, if you are incompetent at your job they'll create one for you and promote you, if you worked with your manager at a previous job you get special treatment, safety isn't job number one, no ability for upward movement unless you complain all the time about your job and they'll put you in secret teams with more ability for growth, the older you are the less likely you'll keep your job through a restructuring of the company"

338,"Good for Working Students Good payment for a working student. Good place to get experienced. Friendly and helpful co-workers. The company is so hierarchical, every decision and act takes time. Almost everyone is working in more than one project, because of that communication and coordination takes time."
339,"High tech and fast paced The company focuses on retaining a high-end, high-tech product portfolio. Work in this area can be pretty exciting and rewarding. The company management is supportive. Very fast paced with schedules that cannot slip. Lots of new business - sometimes feels like more than the workforce can handle."
340,Pros and Cons Better work life balance and std. package limited career growth and poor management
341,Pretty good Laid back atmosphere. Do not feel overworked at any time. That is not due to lack of work. Automotive is a slow industry
342,"Financial Controller good team spirit, supportive collegues, ... bad erp system and it-performance"
343,Good to work Technical work is very good Flexible timings Career growth is too good Management is not so good No recognition and appreciation No support from management related to technical stuffs
344,"We used to be great Decent benefits Friendly co-workers Visionary early founders Acquisition ruined the company Tech is aimless with minimal or no real world significance Focus on short term corporate goals, sacrificing real long term research Our fleet is not growing Not hiring at all Good people leaving the company with no news or updates from the management, in USA or SG Feels like a fight for survival sometimes HR in USA is a joke"
345,"Good Company with good management Global expertise, good people, good culture Favoritism, Partial to certain people- some managers"
346,"Great place to start off your career As title says, it is great place to start your career. I have been working with Aptiv(previously Delphi Automotive Systems) for 7+ years. You will have great learning curve at the beginning. As the number of years progressed, opportunity has reduced. No defined role which leads to good learbing at the beginning of career, but later feels like Jack of all, master of none."
347,"No long term strategy Well positioned portfolio, Compensation is good. Leadership does not follow company's values, lack of synergy among different business units."
348,Super company Good to learn this place HR not like HR nod good
349,"Braga Technical Center - Young Team; - Very nice atmosphere; - New Open-space office; - Focus on results, not people; - Technical Center is still starting; - Not so much travel as they promise"
350,"Not at all comfortable place to work Nothing much. Retirement benefits are good. I was interviewed for one role and was given totally different role when I joined. Lot of work pressure. Management not sensible. Poor work culture . Expected to work on weekends, infact 24x7. They intentionally keep 1 hr meetings at 6pm. I was assigned bugs on Day2. My worst job experience so far in life.no good Chairs. No work life balance. I have to survive until I find a good job"
351,"AptivMobility Great colleagues, great work space environment. Awesome industry. Progression is non existent unless you're friends with the management."
352,Design engineer good working environment and no full night shifts no flexible shift and alternate Saturday working
353,"Polyvalent at Aptiv Salary always on time,health care,paid transport to work. Very frequent work at saturdays and working over time (although paid over time) Very stressful,unhealthy relationships between employees Broken and half decent machines,tools and equipment Bad work environment (super high temperatures with bad air flow) Employees with the same amount of hours at the same positions,even started working for the company the same day, getting different salaries (didnt make any penalties yet their salaries being poorly calculated, a.k.a. robbed,if you prefere) Super high unrealistic expectations from employees,that are working on broken/malfunctioning machines and tools Family and long time relationships dictating who gets promoted and who doesn't"
354,"I have loved working here so far. The people genuinely care about each other and their users! Great team, management listens to employees and works to address any concerns, good atmosphere even after acquisition. The employees genuinely care about making a safe and reliable product. Still maturing as an organization"
355,Excellent learning Opportunity excellent team to work with upcoming technologies facilities provided are not that much good
356,Software Engineer Not a single thing to look forward to. worst culture ever one can imagine
357,In state of flux Cater to milenials. Try to add youth to an aging workforce. Aptiv is tryy to figure out what they are. Constant change and no security. Moving jobs offshore whenever possible.
358,"Great Company to work with Good environment, good benefits, I would recommend it. During the time I worked there I saw no Cons"
359,Sinking Ship. Run fast in the opposite direction None that are worth the headache. No leadership. Terrible work environment. Executives lie through their teeth about the state of the company... which is not good.
360,"VO Awesome technology Good working environment Friendly colleague Bad management, lots of last minute plans, double management, managers are not on the ground and lack of knowledge. Bad communication between different teams, always make it mess. Zero career progression of current team, unless transfer to other teams and start as a fresh. Managers are actually do nothing but get more pay. Resources are limited for fresh to learn and get trained."
361,"Toxic chaos. Pay above market, reasonably good IT. Too many international development groups, too much offshoring. Inefficient communications as a result of offshoring. Chaotic product development and late hours."
362,"Good company Nice company, can learn many things Nothing to say about cons"
363,"if you are used to internal politics, do join, you will enjoy office timing is good, transportation facility, food, training's cannot work independently, lot of internal politics, everyone in organisation will try to pull you leg so that you don't grow"
364,"Not so gud for growth Good for fresher's to learn Politics , no growth .. not employee friendly,HR department is not gud"
365,"Good place to work and challenge yourself. High technology projects, good management and nice work environment. It's difficult to grow inside the company"
366,Great Company Working with absolutely brilliant people in a diverse environment is just great. A bit of bureaucracy as in all large organizations.
367,Worst working environment. Huge bureaucracy. Lost of upper management levels and departments that are useless. Large company leader in the industry Lots of mid to upper management levels that are only looking not to be fired. No contribution to the business and they lie to the executives about the financials. They make unattainable comments they role out every month and goals never get accomplished since the actual plans are not followed. Work ethics at some director levels are extremely questionable
368,Good company Flexible Work Hours and holiday schedule. Knowledgeable staff Cant think of any Cons
369,2 years at aptiv Good company for your carrier growth. medical is expensive compare to other company.
370,Excellent place to learn and grow Good Management Supportive peers Great work life balance Salary structure is not uniform
371,"Project Engineer Good Working Environment and humanly approach Nothing much, all is well and good"
372,Sold out US workers and lied to those in Ireland They subsidies the lunch room. Management lacks integrity. Executives are allowed to discriminate against employees and are backed bu HR in doing so. Career growth has been stopped so excellent employees are forced to leave. Management also sold out US workers with move of the HQ to Ireland. They could have made it work for everyone if they chose. People in Ireland also feel lied to. Just no integrity.
373,"Wonder Full Work Environment Good Work, supportive Management, great Work-Life Balance Growth Depends On the projects"
374,Poland opinion Nice and help-full people in team Management do not see why people left this company
375,Company with good opportunities in automotive sector. Good place to start with. No downsides as such.It also depends on the team one is working with.
376,"Work full of young professionals Many challenges, new projects, elastic work hours, well organised, amazing team integration There are no cons for me at this moment"
377,Very Nice company to work for! Happy tonwork here Employee friendly Management is good Good benefits to employees Flexible working hours Nice learning No pressure Not faced any till now
378,Software Verification Engineer - Student I work at a student lab. Great place to work part time while pursuing a degree. Leadership that is very understanding about school being a priority. Communication with other Aptiv branches can be sticky
379,"So so Good for New graduates to get experienced Low salary, long working hours, no reepect to loyalty"
380,Professional 1. Very Less Work Pressure 2. Decent Pay 3. Good HR 1. No environment to learn new things
381,Very good company Good leadership and great colleagues Frequent ups and downs and temp layoffs
382,"Good job for start people, atmosphere, events, benefits, multisport payment but the rest is ok"
383,"Run, don't walk to nearest exit. Above market pay, good PTO, Troy campus is beautiful. Layoffs are a common occurrence here so job security is non existent. 400 people were laid off on August 31st with more layoffs in Q4. My new recruiter refuses to work with Aptiv or Delphi to place anybody there due to the constant layoffs. (Wish I knew that before I took the job)"
384,"What happens in Vegas... Salary is very competitive for the area and the cost of living is reasonable, allowing a nice quality of life if you can take the summer heat. Nice to know one can afford to run the A/C and still eat something other than ramen (although there are some terrific noodle places here). Holiday/PTO option is generous when compared to other similar positions in this city and other benefits, such as complimentary snacks/beverages/happy hours, provide additional perks. Casual, comfortable, relaxed dress code is appropriate and much appreciated in the desert. Time off requests are easily approved and having a life outside of work is not just understood, but is actively encouraged. Extremely rapid growth premature to having functioning support systems in place can cause confusion, especially in new hires who are used to traditional, established, old-school style business . Rapid changes, which seem to be the norm, not the exception, might be difficult for employees who are used to rigid structure, micro-managing and strict schedules. No covered parking for employees."
385,Best company to work Nice work environment and friendly co-workers Under staffed for specific roles including mine.
386,Stay away from APTIV chennai office No Pros at this company Saturday working day which will not be communicated during recruitment. they will not allow you to take even 5 leaves in a year.
387,"Hybrid Systems Engineer Challenging work and responsibilities. Very capable systems and tools, reference material online. Strong core structure. Outside Leadership seems to be focused on financials. No longer puts customer or employees as it pillars. Customer Focus is gone, Employee growth and stability is gone. Quality is not focus if it requires investment. Older engineers skating by until retirement. Internal departments no longer working together and instead have to worry about budgets. Sad what this has become."
388,"Senior Financial Analyst Competitive pay, hiring process is straightforward, vacation and holiday is comparable to the big 3, and facilities in Troy are modern and clean. If you have any self-respect, do not work here. The company is highly disorganized. Finance processes are undocumented and adhoc. Management is out to please themselves and will stab you in the back if need be."
389,"Current State Product Lines are innovative and high-tech Leadership is only concerned with pleasing Wall Street, mergers and acquisitions, and short-term cost cutting at the expense of continuous improvement. People, required skill sets, and basic business fundamentals are not a concern."
390,Driver Great company to be a part with Not so great company to be a part with
391,Account Manager They offer good base salary They do no have a good work life balance
392,"it's a job, not a career Good pay, flexible work schedule No opportunity for advancement or even moving to a different job, workforce reductions in order to satisfy investors, complete lack of leadership. I have never before seen an organization where supervisors and managers are clueless about what their employees do. The division in Warren is split in 2 groups- wiring and components. There is no ability to move from one to another - even for posted jobs you apply for."
393,"Great Place to work, potential to grow Great Start Salary, job is relatively easy, yet very important at the same time, safety is a major concern, and the company really lets you know that they have your best interest in mind. Literally working on the future of transportation. they provide snacks and drinks to make sure we are well hydrated and have energy for the road. long hours sitting would be my top complaint and rotating 7 day schedule, which the schedule thing really isn't that bad but other than those I have no real gripes."
394,"Self driving autos There are a lot of pros for this job, you have great benefits, great hours, it is a wonderful company to work for everybody is friendly they care about their employees you couldn't find a better job than this one There are no major cons. The only thing that can sometimes bother people is it involves a lot of stress being on the road with other drivers and things are constantly changing but they're changing for the good"
395,Major transition Good working atmosphere Interesting advanced high-tech projects Big enough to offer internal relocation to wide variety of jobs. Chaotic management Struggles a bit to define a new identity after splitting into Aptiv and Delphi Technologies. Micro-management happens quite a lot Rather rore finance than technology driven
396,"If you love driving and working with a different person each day go apply You meet a new person everyday. You will be apart of the future - helping perfect self driving cars. You get benefits, and free food occasionally. You are stuck in a car for 8-9 hours a day with a random person ( Not so bad if you have something in common with the person). The company is still very new, so you have to be able to adapt quickly."
397,Work Life Balance - Salary is Very Good I am working as a Mechanical Engineer in Aptiv. Company's growth is very good. Work life balance. Salaries are on par with Industries. Salaries are very good compared to Mechanical industries. Opportunities are more for software engineers. No on site opportunities. Growth is less for mechanical engineers.
398,Software Development Intern - Autonomous Vehicle Mapping Tons of opportunities to demonstrate your worth and step up to the plate. Expansion of bigger city (Boston and Pittsburgh) offices will attract much better tech talent. Masters or PhD required to work on certain teams.
399,"Strong Growth and Leadership Aptiv provides many opportunities for growth. It's exciting to have mangers that help to foster your career and truly lead by example. It can sometimes be challenging to meet everyone you work with due to the global locations and size of Aptiv,"
400,"Good Place to work good place to work, good culture, good interaction with global teams, exposure to advanced technologies related to autonomous driving, sensors, multimedia.... lesser interaction and transparency with site leadership, HR team is very slow"
401,"Well taken care of Salary, little perks, fellow staff and immediate supervisors. Easy to work with and for. They value an honest days work. Information can be confusing at times and communication can be contradictory but that’s due to the startup nature of this company’s division. Improvements are evident."
402,Been an amazing learning experience! Flexibility in timing. Interesting projects. Friendly work culture. Competitive compensation and work life balance Not much to say. Sometimes work is thrown around instead of being owned up to by the actual person.
403,Great Team with Ownership and high motivation High knowledge and quick actions mentality to make things happen. Strong financial driven and success orientated Processes and Tools could be more lean
404,"Better Salary compared other automotive Company is providing competitive salary compared to other automotive companies, good work life and personal life balance I feel there is no learning for me, apart from that every thing is good"
405,Decent place Good leaders Decent work life balance Nice people to work with Varied career paths within the organization Work culture and flexibility is entirely dependent on the team.
406,"Shippinh & Receiving Supervisor Great team work, wide range of activities to learn from & opportunity to grow Very demanding with working extra hours, tension between departments & people within the operation"
407,"Needs to focus on innovation and R&D Lot of projects. Revenues are all time high. Good project booking, happy shareholders, flexible working hours Lot of projects but most are on support, integration and bug fixes. Need to focus more on design projects, algorithm development and innovation rather than being service centre. Adas is going through a very interesting phase, wish management focuses on cashing in on the opportunity and take up interesting challenges rather than being low cost centre."
408,"A new home Great place to work, good pay, great benefits, great co workers, and great communication with superiors. None found as of yet."
409,"Good Place to work Good Salary, Good Hike, Lots of trainings, Good career growth, No Variable Pay, Team Lunch and Outing Some Managers are HIGHLY unprofessional"
410,"Expert Software Enginner interesting projects, possibilities of promotions, budget for training big corporation with typical problems that you encounter when you get higher in hierarchy (problems with financies, delays, IT etc)"
411,"Good, but still traditional Good people, always willing to help Constant reorgs, relatively low salaries"
412,"Good, but still traditional Good people, always willing to help Constant reorgs, relatively low salaries"
413,Great Company to work 1. Challenging work to perform. 2. New Technologies to learn. 3. Balanced work life. 4. Supportive Management. 5. Good Pay structure. 1. Immature HR department. 2. People are not so helpful.
414,Enjoyable atmosphere. Crazy how a large corporation can have a family feel. Salary is better than most in this area. We are a little understaffed.
415,"Good company to start working Good managers, good colleagues, good opportunity Many trainings, hope start work sooner."
416,"Cutting Edge Technology, Combative Culture Aptiv (formerly Delphi), is at the leading edge of the technological revolution in the automobile. They are one of the best positioned public companies in the space. For an aspiring software engineer or Artificial Intelligence expert, it's probably an excellent place to work. You will likely be challenged to create ground-breaking technology. You'll be involved in something big, which promises to fundamentally change how we live over the next few decades. Of course, one must keep in mind that the separated companies (Aptiv and Delphi Tech) are also ripe for consolidation. By accepting a role there, you will be joining a company that has a solid chance of being acquired or joining forces with a larger tech or automotive giant. The pay is good, and it should be if you are an engineer that's in demand, or if you are in finance and have to cope with the crap administered from Corporate. Benefits are solid, but don't expect HR to do much to help you with anything. You're definitely on your own at this Company. I worked at Corporate, so I cannot say what it's like being an engineer. I can say that working in Corporate Finance, or anywhere near the C-suite is a most unpleasant experience. The general culture is, in one word, combative. I've worked for other large companies, and never seen anything like it. The hours will be long, tense, and filled with angry, aggressive people. Management runs a tight ship, but has created a toxic, unpleasant environment. One can expect profanity, irrational anger, backstabbing, displaced aggression, red-faced put-downs of employees, threats of firing, and the occasional crying assistant. Employees even joke about the level of stress and misery of people on ""the fifth floor"" in Michigan. There's a reason there is so much turnover in the finance department and other Corporate functions. Overall, my time at the Company was an awful, unrewarding experience I came to regret. Don't go to Corporate unless you have a take no prisoners attitude and a thick skin."
417,"Great Employees, Supremely Disloyal HR Flexible work schedule, competitive pay (for me, anyway), exciting products in cutting edge tech spaces. Seemingly volatile corporate HR needs. Ask current and former corporate employees how many times they saw sudden staffing cuts or job relocation they disagreed with or thought was handled wrong."
418,"Autonomous operator Great benefits, great coworkers, treated well by management and supervisors. Flexible schedules, great environment to work in. None yet, everyone and everybody has been great"
419,Century Old Company 1. Less work Pressure 2. Corporate Culture 3. Strict Internal Controls 1. No flexible timings for even executives in Manufacturing plant. 2. Lots of hierarchy for approvals
