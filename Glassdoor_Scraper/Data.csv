Not very tough recruiting A Player Talent as Aptiv is a place where most want to work.,Need to focus on career growth and promoting within.

4,Aptiv,3,Current Employee,It is one of the leaders in the automotive industry in the tier-1 supplier's segment.,"High pressure for hitting numbers, it is more important than people. You feel that no reasons are valid if you don't hit the numbers. It is typical behavior in US companies, I have worked in other previously.",07-Nov-20, Supply Chain in Dublin, Dublin,
5,Black stain on the IDA - Kevin and Joe Show - no encore needed,1,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","The marketing department is great at creating positive reviews on glassdoor. Disregard the obvious fake reviews, challenging work environment is short for toxic and unraveling as a recent million dollar survey announced. Can be hard to get your head around the global scale and complex divisional structures really means aptiv is full of fiefdom, to get anything done you need to follow a broken process using broken systems for no thought out reason for no recognition. Question anything - fired. have an opinion - fired. talk out of turn - fired. try something different - fired. The fear and toxic culture comes from CEO CFO dynamic duo all they way down - the need to impress wall street at all costs means nothing matters only numbers. Culture is a joke there is none. They are Trumpian rip off merchants overpaying themselves to fly all over the world telling people how important they are, Look out for them with their begging bowl in the coming months.",Everything about this place is a con. Dont worry they will be shedding most of the irish workforce soon enough and move onto the next country willing to put up with the Kevin and Joe show.,11-May-20, Financial Analyst in Dublin, Dublin,

9,Soulless company that grinds you into dust,1,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Beautiful offices, friendly work colleagues, free coffee and food, central location.","This is the hardest company I've ever worked for - hard not because of the work, but because leadership make loyalty very difficult. I've spent my entire time here constantly wondering if the scheduled meeting with my manager is about me being fired. Honestly, I am only here until they fire me (which could be any day even though I excel in my reviews) or when I find a better job. Aptiv has either fired or lost all the hardworking, competent and talented staff they had in the last six months. Why? Because they are likely showing up their managers by being able to answer the questions and solve the problems they can't. And, of course costs, despite raising the GDP of a small nation in investment in the last quarter. To get a bit of perspective on the culture here: Aptiv's CEO told all staff on a company-wide call that work-life balance was a myth and you should structure your life around Aptiv. Morale is at an all time low. I wasn't experienced in the manufacturing sector prior to joining, and its a cut-throat sector. Aptiv is a manufacturing company trying to pivot into a tech company, but all senior leadership are from the manufacturing sector. American manufacturing management mythologies, everything is about cutting cents, so that the leadership can bolster their stock options.",28-Aug-20, Corporate Ops in Dublin, Dublin,
10,Great Company with Progressive Technology,5,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Rare opportunity in Ireland to work in the automotive manufacturing industry. Genuine career opportunities. The company truly embraces diversity. Strong CEO and sense of being in the right place at the right time. Salary, pension and health benefits above average but bonus is only average. Good social scene, great offices and location, free breakfast, friendly co-workers and some memorable nights out.",Top-heavy management structure. Unfortunately there are too many middle management layers who only have administration/delegation capability rather than hands-on capability and direct experience.,24-Nov-19, Anonymous Employee ,,

16,"If Carlsberg did bad places to work, they probably wouldn't be as bad as here",1,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Very little really, many were sold a vision that never actually had c-level commitment behind it. Then people were told that this was never what was said in the first place. There is no forward-thinking going on (at least within the Dublin office). If anyone tries to do something new massive resistance is put in their way and in some cases they are just 'removed' to stop their efforts. They got a large number of very talented people to leave good jobs based on both a large salary jump and a promise of interesting and challenging work, for many the sweet taste of the increased paycheck has well soured since very little of the work they were hired to do ever got a budget or support to proceed. So Pros: You might get a salary bump, but you'll regret it nearly instantly. The location is very good. The building is great if you want to 'look' like you work in a modern company.","Where to start. Basics: No parking, no stock for normal employees, exceptionally poor leadership, nearly everything is out-sourced. For Dublin in particular, pretending to be Corporate HQ is a joke, as a site it is so removed from the actual activities of the wider company it may as well be a call center. No culture, in fact, the employees recently got the blame for a bad culture score, the remedy? Hold an all-hands where we were told ""Go make a better culture"", this must be the only improvement program they haven't out-sourced, which goes to show how much they care about that. Relocated numerous staff members from various countries only to now make a sizable number of them redundant, very classy move. Hire numerous talented IT professionals than not support them either by connecting them with the wider company or budgeting for the work they were hired to do. Sack people who rocked the apple cart and actually started to make a difference across many functions IT, SCM and Finance.",09-Nov-19, IT in Dublin, Dublin,

30,Coolest job ever!,1,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Cool cars when they worked. The invaluable lessons learned from the disgusting emotional games that were honestly well played. The blatant, wide spread drug use was fun! If your goal is to see the worst humans have to offer in the workplace this is the spot for you! Moving up was relatively easy for the chosen few, a bathroom bump and hump is all it took. If you did find yourself in a sticky situation that would make the company/tech look bad, no worries because they will cover it all up and still keep you working until you’re no longer needed.","Upper management, middle management, all management especially the HR department. The complete disregard for the humanity of operators. The social/political tactics used by far are some of the most vile and amazingly well executed I’m a bit jealous. They are predatory sociopaths and very adept at exploiting personal issues and working as a well oiled pack to systematically break you down so you quit or stop caring entirely so they fire you. Every day was a slow drip of your existence being squeezed out of you drop by drop, all while your tormentors smiled and said good job everyone while simultaneously picking the next groups of stragglers to make an example of. But if you were one of the actual good ones taking true pride in what you did and exceeded the standards, oh they took delight in making sure they broke you down proper and with devastating precision.",12-May-21, Autonomous Vehicle Operator in Las Vegas, NV,

They cut way too many employees masked as covid issues. This place will work you to the bone and ask for more as you bleed out. Those that are there are stuck there due to visas which i think they did on purpose for cheaper labor as well as employee retention. I have never walked through an office where people are so sad that they are stuck with thier current situation. Upper management keeps saying they are going to make it better - and then has a re-org. within the last 3 years there have been at least 3 re-orgs. if that doesnt sell you RED FLAG i dont know what will. stay away from TROY location.",15-May-21, Engineer in Troy, MI,
32,Toxic Work Environment,1,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","The pay was great for the midwest, but that's likely the only way they can get people to join","I've never worked in a more toxic environment in my career. People are throw under the bus regularly for things that were the fault of management. Job security is abysmal - I've never seen so many people let go from an organization, and no, this was pre-Covid, so it can't be blamed on that contraction. At the same time, the amount of corporate waste and wheel spinning was mind boggling. It doesn't seem like there's a clear strategy at the top - projects are started, killed, restarted, killed again. Honestly, I don't know how this company stays in business - oh yeah, I do! If you're a Tier 1 auto supplier your OEM customers can't afford to let you go out of business. GM was right to spin out this anchor before it dragged them to the bottom with it.",22-May-21, Anonymous Employee ,,

213,The gap between employer branding and reality,2,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Colleagues, salary, flextime, proximity to the university campus, parking lot situation, interesting technological challenges.","Human resources needs to cope with the projects won is usually estimated intentionally optimistically. Why do I belive its intentionally? Because it happens all the time and there is no example I am aware of where estimates reflect even close to 60% of what is actually needed. Often, good experts are promoted to engineering group managers (EGMs), although they are the wrong choice when it comes to team development and team empowerment. If a supervisor has good hard skills but still has room for improvement in terms of managing people, he or she should be encouraged to consult HR at an early stage if any conflicts in the team cannot be resolved. The inclusion of HR for problems in the team should not be interpreted as a weakness, flaw or a negative entry in a fictitious file about the team leader, but rather as a virtue and scknowledged by HR as athe right thing to do.. This is very important for a successful and large company like Aptiv, as the organizational structures change regurarly, even if this is not surprising considering the strong position in the market. In general, Aptiv is very successful and there is a lot of projects, which also has very positive side effects that the future is bright in terms of employees having lots of projects and work to be done. However, due to the high workload with hard deadlines, there is far too little time for the EGMs to manage their teams, to identify problems in the team at an early stage and to tackle those. As a result, there are often employees in the same team where some are overloaded and others are bored.",05-Nov-20, Senior Technical Project Manager in Wuppertal,,

244,"Great people, questionable leadership",2,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","This review is subjected to the Allen Park office ONLY. Aptiv acquired Control-Tec, who was great and where most of the pros stem from. Note that other offices have completely different cultures/benefits. - Great people to work with, culture is about making sure everyone is on the same page and just wants to build something great. Teamwork is a non-issue. PMs and devs are your partners through and through. - Cross-functional folks and users are amazing and kind people. Very passionate about their work and willing to help you as much as they can, whether it's teaching, including, and giving constructive feedback. - WLB is great, though once in a while a push is needed to deliver, and with take-as-you-need/unlimited vacation, you can't get better than that (Allen Park office only). - Culture events like board/video game nights, whiskey/beer guilds, bbq days, and food truck summers were plentiful at the Allen Park office.","- Management are often at a disconnect with upper management/leadership strategies, which gets worse at IC level. After Aptiv acquisition, product teams including SME experts were unsure/unconfident about the product they were asked to build. Validation and justifying product decisions/directions was a constant sore point between product and upper management. - Be prepared to be the only UX resource across multiple products/PM's. Once the ratio was 1 UX : 7 PMs : 30+ developers. Be prepared to brutally prioritize and deliver what you can. You are also a PM, but the pay won't reflect this. - During COVID-19, Allen Park Aptiv quietly laid people off after leadership made assurances of that not being the case. 2 months later, and right after 6 weeks of furloughs, layoffs ensued. Roles including mine and high-performing software engineers were affected.",24-Sep-20, User Experience Designer in Allen Park, MI,

They review footage of events on a random basis. They don't tell you that they watched yours and that it was good, you only find out if it was negative and that you will now receive points due to doing something wrong. If you speak out you will be targeted as being anti Aptiv and non positive, even for those people that have a constant postive outlook. The workforce is over extended. They over hired and luckily they aren't having layoffs, but if you are targeted, they will find a reason to let you go. There is no future growth. Sure most of us have been with the company as an operator for a year, but they created Leads nearly a year ago with many of them being related or having formerly worked with upper management. Leads haven't actively done the job of those they lead since new title. Knowing that HR does not represent employees, but the company is one way to hopefully stay clear of HR personnel. Constant online training that doesn't really cover what job entails but makes management feel like they are teaching us better tricks. Track training is backwards. If you do X all day, we should review X at the track, yet track training is nearly unrelated to actual part of job. Overall this is a job and one that you may be able to keep for a year or two but with accidents and the constant driving, there are just too many opportunities to gain points for minor errors, which will lead to termination. Random drug and alcohol tests, in which even using CBD oil could be flagged for a positive and immediate termination without option for second test. Yet there are drivers and non drivers that smoke. Yet you will be asked each quarter if you know anybody that does, and it isn't anonymous, so people are required to lie as we wouldn't want to inform on them.",16-Jul-19, Driver ,,

And the job itself is cool and cutting edge. Most of the people are cool and will get down after work.","Benefits are expensive and require somewhat significant additional costs ( hope you don’t actually need healthcare) the management is more talk than action and tell you to do one thing and they do another (usually something they told you not to do) Communication is poor at times, seems like they don’t pass on the important stuff to one another. HR is a nightmare and deliberately targets workers with what seems like impunity and personal motivations. The free meal every week is at times questionable (undercooked chicken and stuff like that) the lunch break is a bit short. Drivers voice concerns and they don’t seem to hold a lot of value, even with things concerning safety or similar issues. Overall the environment is a “do as I say, not as I do” mentality, and if you don’t like it leave. You have a personal life? That’s fine as long as it doesn’t interfere with your job of being a taxi driver. Favoritism is alive and well, but don’t say anything about it. They know and don’t seem to care. The people who take it serious and want to do the best they can and are genuine don’t matter. Fake it until you make it is the name of the game. Oh and want to make one of those confidential complaints or report an issue? Better do it from somewhere else because the so called line and website to do so is not even accessible from your work phone or office WiFi, and the number provided is apparently disconnected and unreachable!

545,"Cutting Edge Technology, Combative Culture",1,Former Employee,"Aptiv (formerly Delphi), is at the leading edge of the technological revolution in the automobile. They are one of the best positioned public companies in the space. For an aspiring software engineer or Artificial Intelligence expert, it's probably an excellent place to work. You will likely be challenged to create ground-breaking technology. You'll be involved in something big, which promises to fundamentally change how we live over the next few decades. Of course, one must keep in mind that the separated companies (Aptiv and Delphi Tech) are also ripe for consolidation. By accepting a role there, you will be joining a company that has a solid chance of being acquired or joining forces with a larger tech or automotive giant. The pay is good, and it should be if you are an engineer that's in demand, or if you are in finance and have to cope with the crap administered from Corporate. Benefits are solid, but don't expect HR to do much to help you with anything. You're definitely on your own at this Company.","I worked at Corporate, so I cannot say what it's like being an engineer. I can say that working in Corporate Finance, or anywhere near the C-suite is a most unpleasant experience. The general culture is, in one word, combative. I've worked for other large companies, and never seen anything like it. The hours will be long, tense, and filled with angry, aggressive people. Management runs a tight ship, but has created a toxic, unpleasant environment. One can expect profanity, irrational anger, backstabbing, displaced aggression, red-faced put-downs of employees, threats of firing, and the occasional crying assistant. Employees even joke about the level of stress and misery of people on ""the fifth floor"" in Michigan. There's a reason there is so much turnover in the finance department and other Corporate functions. Overall, my time at the Company was an awful, unrewarding experience I came to regret.
