Not very tough recruiting A Player Talent as Aptiv is a place where most want to work.","1":"Global Work Environment, Cutting Edge Technology Sector, Interesting Challenges","2":"A very fast paced environment - you definitely won't be bored and you learn lots in a short space of time A very global company- exciting to work with some many colleagues from all over the world, if a little daunting at first You can make decisions fast - less bureaucracy that other companies Really nice office facilities, young energetic team of people, good work colleagues.","3":"Excellent office, good staff, good pay, good benefits","4":"It is one of the leaders in the automotive industry in the tier-1 supplier's segment.","5":"The marketing department is great at creating positive reviews on glassdoor. Disregard the obvious fake reviews, challenging work environment is short for toxic and unraveling as a recent million dollar survey announced. Can be hard to get your head around the global scale and complex divisional structures really means aptiv is full of fiefdom, to get anything done you need to follow a broken process using broken systems for no thought out reason for no recognition. Question anything - fired. have an opinion - fired. talk out of turn - fired. try something different - fired. The fear and toxic culture comes from CEO CFO dynamic duo all they way down - the need to impress wall street at all costs means nothing matters only numbers. Culture is a joke there is none. They are Trumpian rip off merchants overpaying themselves to fly all over the world telling people how important they are, Look out for them with their begging bowl in the coming months.","6":"Fairly okay salary, key stakeholders good to work with","7":"good package comparing to other companies","8":"#NAME?","9":"Beautiful offices, friendly work colleagues, free coffee and food, central location.","10":"Rare opportunity in Ireland to work in the automotive manufacturing industry.

Then people were told that this was never what was said in the first place. There is no forward-thinking going on (at least within the Dublin office). If anyone tries to do something new massive resistance is put in their way and in some cases they are just 'removed' to stop their efforts. They got a large number of very talented people to leave good jobs based on both a large salary jump and a promise of interesting and challenging work, for many the sweet taste of the increased paycheck has well soured since very little of the work they were hired to do ever got a budget or support to proceed. So Pros: You might get a salary bump, but you'll regret it nearly instantly. The location is very good. The building is great if you want to 'look' like you work in a modern company.","17":"Some good people, all struggling to survive such a toxic environment","18":"shiny new office (fancy fingerprint sign-in doesnt always work) , handy to DART. that's about it really....","19":"The environment is changing to become more a of software development company and focus on next generation automotive solutions for the brain and nervous system of the automobile.

The invaluable lessons learned from the disgusting emotional games that were honestly well played. The blatant, wide spread drug use was fun! If your goal is to see the worst humans have to offer in the workplace this is the spot for you! Moving up was relatively easy for the chosen few, a bathroom bump and hump is all it took. If you did find yourself in a sticky situation that would make the company\/tech look bad, no worries because they will cover it all up and still keep you working until you\u2019re no longer needed.","31":"not many i can attest to, maybe the people ?","32":"The pay was great for the midwest, but that's likely the only way they can get people to join","33":"You can learn a lot!

They are one of the best positioned public companies in the space. For an aspiring software engineer or Artificial Intelligence expert, it's probably an excellent place to work. You will likely be challenged to create ground-breaking technology. You'll be involved in something big, which promises to fundamentally change how we live over the next few decades. Of course, one must keep in mind that the separated companies (Aptiv and Delphi Tech) are also ripe for consolidation. By accepting a role there, you will be joining a company that has a solid chance of being acquired or joining forces with a larger tech or automotive giant. The pay is good, and it should be if you are an engineer that's in demand, or if you are in finance and have to cope with the crap administered from Corporate.

Dont worry they will be shedding most of the irish workforce soon enough and move onto the next country willing to put up with the Kevin and Joe show.","6":"HR is all over the place, no centralised HR, global comms are not aligned with local comms, miscommunication, favoritism, no annual bonus, poor incentives for HR team","7":"IT chaos in terms of org and process","8":"#NAME?","9":"This is the hardest company I've ever worked for - hard not because of the work, but because leadership make loyalty very difficult. I've spent my entire time here constantly wondering if the scheduled meeting with my manager is about me being fired. Honestly, I am only here until they fire me (which could be any day even though I excel in my reviews) or when I find a better job. Aptiv has either fired or lost all the hardworking, competent and talented staff they had in the last six months. Why? Because they are likely showing up their managers by being able to answer the questions and solve the problems they can't. And, of course costs, despite raising the GDP of a small nation in investment in the last quarter. To get a bit of perspective on the culture here: Aptiv's CEO told all staff on a company-wide call that work-life balance was a myth and you should structure your life around Aptiv. Morale is at an all time low. I wasn't experienced in the manufacturing sector prior to joining, and its a cut-throat sector. Aptiv is a manufacturing company trying to pivot into a tech company, but all senior leadership are from the manufacturing sector. American manufacturing management mythologies, everything is about cutting cents, so that the leadership can bolster their stock options.","10":"Top-heavy management structure. Unfortunately there are too many middle management layers who only have administration\/delegation capability rather than hands-on capability and direct experience.","11":"Work life balance. Slow hierarchical progression.","12":"Micro management, really bad culture as in NO culture. Really showing true colours during Covid forcing people to take holidays and unpaid leave and laying people off redundancies HR totally useless","13":"Can be hard to get your head around the global scale and complex divisional structures.","14":"Terrible challenge Poor management NO leadership Highly political environment Company is doing terribly, many job losses","15":"HR policies need extensive revision.","16":"Where to start. Basics: No parking, no stock for normal employees, exceptionally poor leadership, nearly everything is out-sourced. For Dublin in particular, pretending to be Corporate HQ is a joke, as a site it is so removed from the actual activities of the wider company it may as well be a call center. No culture, in fact, the employees recently got the blame for a bad culture score, the remedy? Hold an all-hands where we were told \"Go make a better culture\", this must be the only improvement program they haven't out-sourced, which goes to show how much they care about that. Relocated numerous staff members from various countries only to now make a sizable number of them redundant, very classy move. Hire numerous talented IT professionals than not support them either by connecting them with the wider company or budgeting for the work they were hired to do. Sack people who rocked the apple cart and actually started to make a difference across many functions IT, SCM and Finance.","17":"Toxic culture primarily due to leadership team. Employees are not valued. No recognition, appreciation or support. All are disposable widgets to be used and then discarded.","18":"let's face it, it's going about as well as Brexit. Weak , inexperienced US managment on their first international assignment are out of their depth and struggling. Supply chain , finance and tax are complete losses- just stay clear of them .......","19":"Very demanding management teams to get more done in an environment with constant change, turnover, and knowledge gaps.","20":"Too much red tape, Slow decision making, Very Hierarchical. Weak senior staff","21":"Pace can be hectic at times Priorities can shift quickly with little warning","22":"very complex ,jobs very specialised","23":"Remuneration often not worth it, no matter how much. Finance and tax function is mad. Senior management can be counter productive and drive away people or minimises motivation. Unrealistic expectations and approach from certain leaders creates uncomfortable workplace.","24":"HR unsophisticated not strategic, staff are a number treated badly, staff under huge pressure to deliver to unrealistic deadlines, Dublin corp office hiring and firing within 11 month probation period pulling people out of secure jobs then dumping them callously, no management structures in place, a lot of shouting, staff distressed within months of being there, American managers think they are in US not Ireland using US practices a lawsuit waiting to happen","25":"Not a technology company. Sterile office environment. Unreasonable expectations. Rough, micro-managing senior leadership, especially within Finance. Monolithic culture that does not seem to embrace differences. People are angry and disengaged. Lots of screamers. Work for the sake of work, which creates constant swirl.","26":"Be able to move every year arround the world.","27":"No work life balance...managers rule by fear....unreasonable expectations","28":"None! There are always issues with companies going through significant change, but at Aptiv, they\u2019re very good at getting out in front of them and communicating clearly, there really are no issues that aren\u2019t acknowledged and being addressed at pace.","29":"No share purchase plan Dependency on suppliers","30":"Upper management, middle management, all management especially the HR department. The complete disregard for the humanity of operators. The social\/political tactics used by far are some of the most vile and amazingly well executed I\u2019m a bit jealous. They are predatory sociopaths and very adept at exploiting personal issues and working as a well oiled pack to systematically break you down so you quit or stop caring entirely so they fire you. Every day was a slow drip of your existence being squeezed out of you drop by drop, all while your tormentors smiled and said good job everyone while simultaneously picking the next groups of stragglers to make an example of. But if you were one of the actual good ones taking true pride in what you did and exceeded the standards, oh they took delight in making sure they broke you down proper and with devastating precision.","31":"Everything - This place does not have an idea what Agile really means, it implements everything on a separate agenda aka there is no coordination at the TROY location let alone the global platoform which is a mess of its own. They cut way too many employees masked as covid issues. This place will work you to the bone and ask for more as you bleed out. Those that are there are stuck there due to visas which i think they did on purpose for cheaper labor as well as employee retention. I have never walked through an office where people are so sad that they are stuck with thier current situation. Upper management keeps saying they are going to make it better - and then has a re-org. within the last 3 years there have been at least 3 re-orgs. if that doesnt sell you RED FLAG i dont know what will. stay away from TROY location.","32":"I've never worked in a more toxic environment in my career. People are throw under the bus regularly for things that were the fault of management. Job security is abysmal - I've never seen so many people let go from an organization, and no, this was pre-Covid, so it can't be blamed on that contraction. At the same time, the amount of corporate waste and wheel spinning was mind boggling. It doesn't seem like there's a clear strategy at the top - projects are started, killed, restarted, killed again. Honestly, I don't know how this company stays in business - oh yeah, I do! If you're a Tier 1 auto supplier your OEM customers can't afford to let you go out of business. GM was right to spin out this anchor before it dragged them to the bottom with it.","33":"Frequent overtime work Sometimes lack of understanding of local needs by global management","34":"- Some old org. structures, not flexible enough for fast market changes - Managers not always comply with company's values","35":"Typical corporate bureaucratic stuff. Years to get anything done. Years to get funding approved but then management asks why we didn't have the project completed 3 years before we even launch it.","36":"Need to work on review processes","37":"Demanding employer as APTIV wants to be market leader on ADAS","38":"management isnt the best if i","39":"complex company, from the structure perpective","40":"-Is a big company in transformation, some processes are very slow and if you don't have a stomach for bureaucracy, will not fit for you","41":"Nothing is negative.

Because it happens all the time and there is no example I am aware of where estimates reflect even close to 60% of what is actually needed. Often, good experts are promoted to engineering group managers (EGMs), although they are the wrong choice when it comes to team development and team empowerment. If a supervisor has good hard skills but still has room for improvement in terms of managing people, he or she should be encouraged to consult HR at an early stage if any conflicts in the team cannot be resolved. The inclusion of HR for problems in the team should not be interpreted as a weakness, flaw or a negative entry in a fictitious file about the team leader, but rather as a virtue and scknowledged by HR as athe right thing to do.. This is very important for a successful and large company like Aptiv, as the organizational structures change regurarly, even if this is not surprising considering the strong position in the market. In general, Aptiv is very successful and there is a lot of projects, which also has very positive side effects that the future is bright in terms of employees having lots of projects and work to be done. However, due to the high workload with hard deadlines, there is far too little time for the EGMs to manage their teams, to identify problems in the team at an early stage and to tackle those.

Sure most of us have been with the company as an operator for a year, but they created Leads nearly a year ago with many of them being related or having formerly worked with upper management. Leads haven't actively done the job of those they lead since new title. Knowing that HR does not represent employees, but the company is one way to hopefully stay clear of HR personnel. Constant online training that doesn't really cover what job entails but makes management feel like they are teaching us better tricks. Track training is backwards. If you do X all day, we should review X at the track, yet track training is nearly unrelated to actual part of job. Overall this is a job and one that you may be able to keep for a year or two but with accidents and the constant driving, there are just too many opportunities to gain points for minor errors, which will lead to termination. Random drug and alcohol tests, in which even using CBD oil could be flagged for a positive and immediate termination without option for second test. Yet there are drivers and non drivers that smoke.

Besides, taking up Aboard Trips from start till bill settlement is hectic.","405":"Benefits aren't as competitive as I hoped while on-boarding process isn't very clear and concise.","406":"Upper management seems too focused on company politics, which prevents actual development and success","407":"Worst canteen. Bachelors struggle for food. No fun at work","408":"Benefits are expensive and require somewhat significant additional costs ( hope you don\u2019t actually need healthcare) the management is more talk than action and tell you to do one thing and they do another (usually something they told you not to do) Communication is poor at times, seems like they don\u2019t pass on the important stuff to one another. HR is a nightmare and deliberately targets workers with what seems like impunity and personal motivations. The free meal every week is at times questionable (undercooked chicken and stuff like that) the lunch break is a bit short. Drivers voice concerns and they don\u2019t seem to hold a lot of value, even with things concerning safety or similar issues. Overall the environment is a \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d mentality, and if you don\u2019t like it leave. You have a personal life? That\u2019s fine as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with your job of being a taxi driver. Favoritism is alive and well, but don\u2019t say anything about it. They know and don\u2019t seem to care. The people who take it serious and want to do the best they can and are genuine don\u2019t matter. Fake it until you make it is the name of the game. Oh and want to make one of those confidential complaints or report an issue? Better do it from somewhere else because the so called line and website to do so is not even accessible from your work phone or office WiFi, and the number provided is apparently disconnected and unreachable! If you are looking to waste your time but collect a check this is for you! Show up, shut up, and do the minimum is the name of the game. And their so called transparency is just that, so called. They tell you what you want to hear and you\u2019re supposed to like it.","409":"Aptiv do not care about its own people, became US centric since few years","410":"It is distracting when you are concerned that another round of restructuring will catch you in their net.","411":"#NAME?","412":"Travel outside of Region. Travel in security challenged areas.","413":"#NAME?","414":"Bad upper management. Yearly reviews can be painfull. Pretty slow career progression. Not a good work life balance package.

I felt good.","441":"As the number of years progressed, opportunity has reduced. No defined role which leads to good learbing at the beginning of career, but later feels like Jack of all, master of none.","442":"Leadership does not follow company's values, lack of synergy among different business units.","443":"HR not like HR nod good","444":"- Focus on results, not people; - Technical Center is still starting; - Not so much travel as they promise","445":"I was interviewed for one role and was given totally different role when I joined. Lot of work pressure. Management not sensible. Poor work culture . Expected to work on weekends, infact 24x7. They intentionally keep 1 hr meetings at 6pm. I was assigned bugs on Day2. My worst job experience so far in life.no good Chairs. No work life balance. I have to survive until I find a good job","446":"Progression is non existent unless you're friends with the management.","447":"no flexible shift and alternate Saturday working","448":"Bad management. High stress. Ungratefull. Salary for high positions is good, whil for lower positions is very low compared to other companies.","449":"Very frequent work at saturdays and working over time (although paid over time) Very stressful,unhealthy relationships between employees Broken and half decent machines,tools and equipment Bad work environment (super high temperatures with bad air flow) Employees with the same amount of hours at the same positions,even started working for the company the same day, getting different salaries (didnt make any penalties yet their salaries being poorly calculated, a.k.a. robbed,if you prefere) Super high unrealistic expectations from employees,that are working on broken\/malfunctioning machines and tools Family and long time relationships dictating who gets promoted and who doesn't","450":"Still maturing as an organization","451":"facilities provided are not that much good","452":"worst culture ever one can imagine","453":"Aptiv is tryy to figure out what they are. Constant change and no security. Moving jobs offshore whenever possible.","454":"During the time I worked there I saw no Cons","455":"No leadership. Terrible work environment. Executives lie through their teeth about the state of the company... which is not good.","456":"Responding to market trends in a safe way","457":"Bad management, lots of last minute plans, double management, managers are not on the ground and lack of knowledge. Bad communication between different teams, always make it mess. Zero career progression of current team, unless transfer to other teams and start as a fresh. Managers are actually do nothing but get more pay. Resources are limited for fresh to learn and get trained.","458":"Too many international development groups, too much offshoring. Inefficient communications as a result of offshoring. Chaotic product development and late hours.","459":"Long working hours working week end overtime cultur massive turn over ressources are not valuable","460":"Seems like the folks at the top just like to cut, cut, cut when it comes to resources and I'm talking the human kind. People are doing the work of at least 2 people if not 3 in some cases. Some folks leave the office but not the job, they get home and are back at work for meetings or to finish up things. There is no training or advancement for most, they have the 'golden' ones already picked to promote. Suits at the top have no idea what goes on down below in the trenches I believe or they wouldn't take the actions they do. I have no idea what their game plan is as of late but it looks like a suicide mission. Decisions as of late have done nothing for the quality of the product, people or name Aptiv. Changes to the health care plan out of pocket are so high many don't even go to the Dr. now because you have to pay for it all yourself, definitely not a perk.","461":"Nothing to say about cons","462":"new company leadership direction not solidified, some inexperienced and not prepared, not sure of direction.","463":"Salary is very less compared to actual standards","464":"cannot work independently, lot of internal politics, everyone in organisation will try to pull you leg so that you don't grow","465":"Culture is not so good","466":"Politics , no growth .. not employee friendly,HR department is not gud","467":"It's difficult to grow inside the company","468":"No career growth for hardware","469":"Work culture is not good.

Late night and excess work is common","471":"the workload is high, work-life balance is not good","472":"A bit of bureaucracy as in all large organizations.","473":"Lots of mid to upper management levels that are only looking not to be fired. No contribution to the business and they lie to the executives about the financials. They make unattainable comments they role out every month and goals never get accomplished since the actual plans are not followed. Work ethics at some director levels are extremely questionable","474":"Cant think of any Cons","475":"medical is expensive compare to other company.","476":"Salary structure is not uniform","477":"Nothing much, all is well and good","478":"Management lacks integrity. Executives are allowed to discriminate against employees and are backed bu HR in doing so. Career growth has been stopped so excellent employees are forced to leave. Management also sold out US workers with move of the HQ to Ireland. They could have made it work for everyone if they chose. People in Ireland also feel lied to. Just no integrity.","479":"fresher dont have growth only experienced","480":"Growth Depends On the projects","481":"Management do not see why people left this company","482":"Most of the projects are in maintaince phase, not much development work.

My new recruiter refuses to work with Aptiv or Delphi to place anybody there due to the constant layoffs. (Wish I knew that before I took the job)","500":"Extremely rapid growth premature to having functioning support systems in place can cause confusion, especially in new hires who are used to traditional, established, old-school style business . Rapid changes, which seem to be the norm, not the exception, might be difficult for employees who are used to rigid structure, micro-managing and strict schedules. No covered parking for employees.","501":"Under staffed for specific roles including mine.","502":"Saturday working day which will not be communicated during recruitment. they will not allow you to take even 5 leaves in a year.","503":"Infrastructure, Nil to Less Growth, Working on outdated technologies","504":"#NAME?","505":"lacks proper management always in a chaos","506":"Outside Leadership seems to be focused on financials. No longer puts customer or employees as it pillars. Customer Focus is gone, Employee growth and stability is gone. Quality is not focus if it requires investment. Older engineers skating by until retirement. Internal departments no longer working together and instead have to worry about budgets. Sad what this has become.","507":"If you have any self-respect, do not work here. The company is highly disorganized. Finance processes are undocumented and adhoc. Management is out to please themselves and will stab you in the back if need be.","508":"Overworked, lacking resources Raises not as large as competition Great workers lost to other companies with better benefits","509":"wages and social benefits are not competetive","510":"Leadership is only concerned with pleasing Wall Street, mergers and acquisitions, and short-term cost cutting at the expense of continuous improvement. People, required skill sets, and basic business fundamentals are not a concern.","511":"Way too much work pressure","512":"Not so great company to be a part with","513":"They do no have a good work life balance","514":"Some procedures are not completely established","515":"Layoffs after only 5 months of employment","516":"No opportunity for advancement or even moving to a different job, workforce reductions in order to satisfy investors, complete lack of leadership. I have never before seen an organization where supervisors and managers are clueless about what their employees do. The division in Warren is split in 2 groups- wiring and components. There is no ability to move from one to another - even for posted jobs you apply for.","517":"long hours sitting would be my top complaint and rotating 7 day schedule, which the schedule thing really isn't that bad but other than those I have no real gripes.","518":"There are no major cons. The only thing that can sometimes bother people is it involves a lot of stress being on the road with other drivers and things are constantly changing but they're changing for the good","519":"Chaotic management Struggles a bit to define a new identity after splitting into Aptiv and Delphi Technologies. Micro-management happens quite a lot Rather rore finance than technology driven","520":"You are stuck in a car for 8-9 hours a day with a random person ( Not so bad if you have something in common with the person). The company is still very new, so you have to be able to adapt quickly.","521":"No on site opportunities. Growth is less for mechanical engineers.","522":"Masters or PhD required to work on certain teams.","523":"Remarkably lean resources and a very short-term, shareholder return at-all-cost mindset. Candor and transparency are not hallmarks of leadership. As you read throughout the reviews, people are walked out for cost reasons on a daily basis.","524":"It can sometimes be challenging to meet everyone you work with due to the global locations and size of Aptiv,","525":"lesser interaction and transparency with site leadership, HR team is very slow","526":"Information can be confusing at times and communication can be contradictory but that\u2019s due to the startup nature of this company\u2019s division. Improvements are evident.","527":"#NAME?","528":"Not much to say. Sometimes work is thrown around instead of being owned up to by the actual person.","529":"After the new CEO came in, the culture completely changed in a bad way. Many good people walked out the door. Management by intimidation. Very unrealistic revenue and margin targets drove all decisions. No Customer focus.","530":"Processes and Tools could be more lean","531":"I feel there is no learning for me, apart from that every thing is good","532":"-Need to maintain balance under pressure and focus on long term strategy -MS tools(PPT & Excel)!!","533":"Work culture and flexibility is entirely dependent on the team.","534":"Very demanding with working extra hours, tension between departments & people within the operation","535":"Lot of projects but most are on support, integration and bug fixes. Need to focus more on design projects, algorithm development and innovation rather than being service centre. Adas is going through a very interesting phase, wish management focuses on cashing in on the opportunity and take up interesting challenges rather than being low cost centre.","536":"None found as of yet.","537":"Some Managers are HIGHLY unprofessional","538":"big corporation with typical problems that you encounter when you get higher in hierarchy (problems with financies, delays, IT etc)","539":"Constant reorgs, relatively low salaries","540":"Constant reorgs, relatively low salaries","541":"1.

I can say that working in Corporate Finance, or anywhere near the C-suite is a most unpleasant experience. The general culture is, in one word, combative. I've worked for other large companies, and never seen anything like it. The hours will be long, tense, and filled with angry, aggressive people. Management runs a tight ship, but has created a toxic, unpleasant environment. One can expect profanity, irrational anger, backstabbing, displaced aggression, red-faced put-downs of employees, threats of firing, and the occasional crying assistant. Employees even joke about the level of stress and misery of people on \"the fifth floor\" in Michigan. There's a reason there is so much turnover in the finance department and other Corporate functions. Overall, my time at the Company was an awful, unrewarding experience I came to regret. Don't go to Corporate unless you have a take no prisoners attitude and a thick skin.","546":"Seemingly volatile corporate HR needs. Ask current and former corporate employees how many times they saw sudden staffing cuts or job relocation they disagreed with or thought was handled wrong.","547":"None yet, everyone and everybody has been great","548":"1. No flexible timings for even executives in Manufacturing plant. 2.
