      "Rating:  1.0\n",
      "Designation:  Current Employee, more than 1 year\n",
      "pros:  Very little really, many were sold a vision that never actually had c-level commitment behind it. Then people were told that this was never what was said in the first place. There is no forward-thinking going on (at least within the Dublin office). If anyone tries to do something new massive resistance is put in their way and in some cases they are just 'removed' to stop their efforts.\n",
      "They got a large number of very talented people to leave good jobs based on both a large salary jump and a promise of interesting and challenging work, for many the sweet taste of the increased paycheck has well soured since very little of the work they were hired to do ever got a budget or support to proceed.\n",
      "So Pros:\n",
      "You might get a salary bump, but you'll regret it nearly instantly.\n",
      "The location is very good.\n",
      "The building is great if you want to 'look' like you work in a modern company.\n",
      "cons:  Where to start.\n",
      "Basics:\n",
      "No parking, no stock for normal employees,  exceptionally poor leadership, nearly everything is out-sourced.\n",
      "For Dublin in particular, pretending to be Corporate HQ is a joke, as a site it is so removed from the actual activities of the wider company it may as well be a call center.\n",
      "No culture, in fact, the employees recently got the blame for a bad culture score, the remedy? Hold an all-hands where we were told  \"Go make a better culture\", this must be the only improvement program they haven't out-sourced, which goes to show how much they care about that.\n",
      "Relocated numerous staff members from various countries only to now make a sizable number of them redundant, very classy move. \n",
      "Hire numerous talented IT professionals than not support them either by connecting them with the wider company or budgeting for the work they were hired to do.\n",
