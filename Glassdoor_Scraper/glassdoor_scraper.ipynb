      "pros:  Very little really, many were sold a vision that never actually had c-level commitment behind it. Then people were told that this was never what was said in the first place. There is no forward-thinking going on (at least within the Dublin office). If anyone tries to do something new massive resistance is put in their way and in some cases they are just 'removed' to stop their efforts.\n",
      "They got a large number of very talented people to leave good jobs based on both a large salary jump and a promise of interesting and challenging work, for many the sweet taste of the increased paycheck has well soured since very little of the work they were hired to do ever got a budget or support to proceed.\n",

      "No parking, no stock for normal employees,  exceptionally poor leadership, nearly everything is out-sourced.\n",

      "No culture, in fact, the employees recently got the blame for a bad culture score, the remedy? Hold an all-hands where we were told  \"Go make a better culture\", this must be the only improvement program they haven't out-sourced, which goes to show how much they care about that.\n",
      "Relocated numerous staff members from various countries only to now make a sizable number of them redundant, very classy move. \n",

If your goal is to see the worst humans have to offer in the workplace this is the spot for you! Moving up was relatively easy for the chosen few, a bathroom bump and hump is all it took.
