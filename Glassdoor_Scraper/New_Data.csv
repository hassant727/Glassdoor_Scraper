545,"Cutting Edge Technology, Combative Culture",1,Former Employee,"Aptiv (formerly Delphi), is at the leading edge of the technological revolution in the automobile. They are one of the best positioned public companies in the space. For an aspiring software engineer or Artificial Intelligence expert, it's probably an excellent place to work. You will likely be challenged to create ground-breaking technology. You'll be involved in something big, which promises to fundamentally change how we live over the next few decades. Of course, one must keep in mind that the separated companies (Aptiv and Delphi Tech) are also ripe for consolidation. By accepting a role there, you will be joining a company that has a solid chance of being acquired or joining forces with a larger tech or automotive giant. The pay is good, and it should be if you are an engineer that's in demand, or if you are in finance and have to cope with the crap administered from Corporate. Benefits are solid, but don't expect HR to do much to help you with anything. You're definitely on your own at this Company.","I worked at Corporate, so I cannot say what it's like being an engineer. I can say that working in Corporate Finance, or anywhere near the C-suite is a most unpleasant experience. The general culture is, in one word, combative. I've worked for other large companies, and never seen anything like it. The hours will be long, tense, and filled with angry, aggressive people. Management runs a tight ship, but has created a toxic, unpleasant environment. One can expect profanity, irrational anger, backstabbing, displaced aggression, red-faced put-downs of employees, threats of firing, and the occasional crying assistant. Employees even joke about the level of stress and misery of people on ""the fifth floor"" in Michigan. There's a reason there is so much turnover in the finance department and other Corporate functions. Overall, my time at the Company was an awful, unrewarding experience I came to regret.
